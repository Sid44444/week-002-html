Dynamic parts to this application include:

The text box for adding things to do.
The total number of things to do after colon.
The done button.
The delete button.
The number of task.
How many tasks there are.
Selection of language.

Problems these dynamic parts may encounter:

The text box may be too small/not scroll.
Does the text box take numbers too?
People may want to see tasks they have completed, so can the task remain with a line through or will this become messy?
Delete tasks; is there a reason for deletion, option to completely delete or cross out?
The numbering of tasks could prove difficult with deletion and done boxes (will the numbers change).
When the task is done should it still have a number and be visable (feeling of accomplishment)?
Will search engines locate this app easily?
Are there other language options?
Grammar and spelling checker for tasks?
